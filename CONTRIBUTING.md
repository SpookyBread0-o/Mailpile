Thanks for contributing to Mailpile!

## When submitting a pull request ##

tl;dr: Please confirm you are OK with your patch being under both the
[AGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)
and the [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) licenses.

We are TEMPORARILY dual-licensing under the Apache 2.0 and AGPLv3 licenses and
will only accept contributions from authors who are willing to grant license
under both of those. We will then drop one of the licenses late this fall,
once we have had the time to debate the matter further and get input from our
community of backers and contributors. This strategy allows us to avoid
requesting copyright assignment or otherwise make our contributors do annoying
paperwork.

Please make it clear in your pull request that you are willing to dual-license
your code under these licences.

Thanks for your understanding!
