Reasons behind Exchange Corruption

When we use the term ‘Exchange Corruption’, it means EDB file corruption. 
EDB file is the Exchange Database file which is the storehouse of all data that resides on the Exchange server. 
Damage or corruption in this file leads to corruption of the Exchange server. 
Some common causes behind EDB file corruption include:
1.Virus infection

2.Improper system shutdown

3.Application malfunction

4.User errors

5.Missing database objects

Database Errors that lead to Corruption
More often than not, the server displays some symptoms that eventually lead up to corruption.
These symptoms are displayed in the form of errors that unexpectedly crop up while trying to perform various operations on the database.
Here’s a list of some common Exchange error codes that lead up to corruption:

Error -515: "JET_errInvalidLogSequence"

One of the log files is missing or doesn’t match the other logs in the sequence.

Error 1018: “JET_errReadVerifyFailure”

Page-level corruption in the EDB file.

Error 1216:  "JET_errAttachedDatabaseMismatch"
